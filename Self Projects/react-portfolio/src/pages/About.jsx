          Hi, I m QA turned MERN Dev , I like to create creative website that
          makes peoples live easy and fun, with added colors of CSS. I have
          previously worked at
          <a href="https://www.optum.com/"> Optum</a> as a dev and as a QA at
          <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-in"> ThoughtWorks</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes I tend to do quote musings while coding, so have compiled
          all my thoughts in the form of an nmp pkg, which you can download from{" "}
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/quotes-of-paradoxical-world">
            {" "}
            here{" "}
          </a>
          and use it in your project when required or when you want to get
          motivated with little bit of jokeðŸ˜œ. A little about my technical
          background, I have passed with "First Class with distinction" along
          with "clearing GATE-2020", which has formed the basis for my CSE
          fundamentals.
